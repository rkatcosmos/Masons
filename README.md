# Masons 
## Objective: 
To arrive at the best strategy to maximise score in a given tetris game.

### Objective Breakup:
#### 1. Build a tetris game 
The arena would be a simple 2D matrix/array. The default values would be zeroes. The [Tetromino](https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/Tetromino) would be shaped in 1s.
Logics to be implemented:
- when a row is filled up to 1s, then the Matrix must be reset to account for points.
- introduce validation means so that there are no bugs like what is in _brick games_.
- the tetromino must be rotatable.
- the tetromino must be translatable.
#### 2. Make Strategy sheets that will make a particular game play 
#### 3. Optimise the strategy
